```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
Adding a `via` color to the gradient, or ensuring the specified colors are valid and compatible, resolves the issue by providing a smoother transition and reducing the potential for conflict with other styles.  Thoroughly checking the specificity of CSS rules and ensuring there are no conflicting styles impacting the element is crucial.

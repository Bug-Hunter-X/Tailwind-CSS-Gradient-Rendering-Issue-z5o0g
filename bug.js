```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  However, if the `from` or `to` colors are not specified correctly, or if there is a conflict with other styles applied, it may not render properly, resulting in a blank space or unexpected appearance.
